## Getting Started

First install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Decisions

My goal was to make a simple website that implements the rijks museum api in an effective way. Since we are working with images, it is important that the quality stays very high at all times. So that was my main objective.
Hence i created a grid system for searching artworks and then a detail page. Which displays the image in it's most optimal resolution taking up a big part of the screen. Another goal for me was to also make it fully responsive, so I have implemented that aswell, again using the grid system in combination with flexbox for the detail page.

### Nice editions
I added a loading icon for when The detail page is loading.  
Added a variety of filter options.  
Added small amounts of animations using framer-motion  
Used typescript.
